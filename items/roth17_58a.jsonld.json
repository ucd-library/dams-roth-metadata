  "schema:description": "[From original label] Linnel Farm Labor Center apartments (right) and shelters (below) have a capacity of about 1,300 in families. Peak occupancy in 1957 was 745 in July. The low point was 460 in April. Author of article (right) chats with mother of an Arkansas family which has lived in the camp since arrival 12 years ago. \"Husband does all types of work on nearby farms, mostly thinning, picking and pruning tree fruits and grapes. He had a steady job for 10 years but quit because it was hourly work. We like piece work now, so we can rest a little. You shouldn't rest much when they pay by the hour. I don't work much now. I baby-sit for my daughter. Two work in the packing shed. Another married a mechanic and moved away.\"",
